# componium

This project is made with help of the cloud9 IDE (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud9_IDE)

Very nice starter from https://www.codementor.io/reactjs/tutorial/beginner-guide-setup-reactjs-environment-npm-babel-6-webpack
(skipping react hot loader for now ... maybe later)

Also installed npm azure-cli (https://azure.microsoft.com/nl-nl/documentation/articles/xplat-cli-install/) and used "azure login" in command line - great success!
